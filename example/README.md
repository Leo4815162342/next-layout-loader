This is a
[`@ceteio/next-layout-loader`](https://github.com/ceteio/next-layout-loader)
example showing automatic loading of `_layout` files from within the `pages/`
directory.

Use the nav at the top (rendered in `pages/_layout.jsx`) to browser around. Each
layout file specifies its own background color.

Layouts also maintain their state across client-side navigations. Click the
"count" button, then navigate to a new URL using one of the links to see it in
action.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
